... printing help topic messages
Debugging:
  Both the standard Verilog XL (TM Cadence Design Systems) statement
  debugger and a command based GDB style debugger are supported.  The
  interactive debugger is not available when compiled simulation is used.
 
  Input is typed from the terminal or read from a file.
  Input is terminated with a new line.  For multi-line commands, all
  but the last line ends with a back slash escaped new line.  The new
  command debugger commands begin with a colon as part of the name and
  cannot be executed from Verilog source.  All interactive commands are
  echoed to the log file unless ':set noecholog' is used to to suppress log
  file command echoing (':set echolog' re-enables).
 
  The debugger is entered by pressing the interrupt key (^c), by calling
  the $stop system task, by the -s command line option, by completing a
  step command, or by hitting a breakpoint.
 
  The $input("[file]") system task causes debugger commands to be read
  from [file] the first time interactive mode is entered (by -s?).  $input
  files do not nest, instead $input in a file causes $input to chain to the
  new file.  Output is written to the screen and the log file.  stderr is
  not used.  All typed user input including command prompts and $input
  commands is written to the log file.  $nolog and $log plus
  $nokeepcommands and $keepcommands can minimize $input script output.
  +nokeepcommands option disables history saving.  It is useful if
  simulation is run from a shell script.

Compiling no interactive debugger:
  When CVC is used to compile designs to machine code, the interactive
  debugger is disabled.  Use the +interp option to select slower
  interpreted simulation and to enable the XL style interactive debugger.
  Use a a wave form based debugger when debugging compiled designs.  CVC
  supports both VCD and Springsoft (Novas) FSDB value change dump formats.
 
  CVC ignores the $stop system task when simulating a compiled design.
  When $stop is executed supressable warning 560 is emitted.  Pressing the
  interrupt key (usually ctrl-c) kills your simulation the sent quit signal
  is passed to your shell.

Debugging using the tracing mechanism:
  An alternative non interactive tracing mechanism is supported.
  Behavioral statement tracing is started with the -t option or $settrace
  system task and stopped by calling $cleartrace.  Event tracing is started
  with the -et option or $setevtrace system task and stopped by calling
  $clearevtrace.  The -et option allows pre time 0 initialization events
  to be traced.  Trace output is written to stdout and the log file unless
  the +tracefile [file name] option or $settracefile([string]) system task
  are used to direct trace output to a separate file.  The trace mechanism
  is intended to allow debugging of parallel activity by searching trace
  output with a debugger.
 
  Trace statements and gates are reconstructed source with parameters
  replaced by numeric values.  Interactive debugger breakpoint and step
  tracing also emit source lines.  To avoid duplicate output if tracing
  and the interactive debugger are used, redirect trace output.
 
  The tracing options works with compiled simulation except only a small
  subset of tracing messages are printed.

Debugger differences from older P1364 LRMs:
  1) Multiple line interactive debugger commands must end with escaped new
  lines.  Verilog statements still require the ending semicolon.
  2) The $settrace system task (also -t) are divided into the two tracing
  classes: $settrace and $setevtrace (-t and -et).
  3) By default when interactive mode is entered the $scope interactive
  scope is set to the current scope.  This allows examination of local
  variables on step or break but may require entering $scope command on
  every interactive entry to run some legacy scripts.  In functions, named
  blocks do not have scope so function scope remains.  Interactivbe variable
  access in function named block must use qualified reference from function
  scope.  To duplicate XL behavior in which interactive scope can only
  be changed by $scope system task, type: ':set noscopechange' inside the
  interactive debugger.  When re-enabling commands from the history list,
  either the command must use rooted names or the scope must be the same
  as the scope when the command was originally entered.
  4) Delay back annotation by specparam assignments not supported, and
  $updatetiming, but similar standard SDF (LABEL form and PLI 2.0 assignment
  to defparams and specparam before delay elaboration supported.

Interactive Verilog statement execution:
  Any Verilog statement can be entered at the interactive mode prompt (or
  in an $input file) except named blocks and initial or always statements.
  No new variables can be declared and all identifiers are accessed using
  the current scope (entry scope or change $scope location).  Compound
  statements and statements with delay or event controls are legal.
  Commands are:
 
   '.'   Exit the debugger and continue execution (event processing).
   ':'   Print the current instance and possibly task scope plus location
         of scope and current :list current location.  Prints scope and
         listing location, use :where for procedural execution location.
   ';'   Silently step through next procedural statement and process all
         events and time movement up to the next procedural statement. The
         current location for the :list command is not changed.  Tasks and
         functions are stepped into.
   ','   Step through next statement and print next source statement.  Same
         as ';' except the next source line to execute is printed.
   -[number]  Disable history command [number] if it has not yet completed.
         The $history task indicates commands that are active with a '*'
   [number]  Re-execute command [number] from the history list only if the
         command has finished (no '*' mark when printed with $history).
         Commands are re-executed in the current scope so if a command sets
         a change or edge breakpoint, it must contain rooted names or be
         executed from the same scope as it's original entry.

Displaying internal circuit values:
  In addition to the normal $display (or $write) system tasks to display
  values use :print to override declared expression base or width (type
  ':help :print' for legal values). Use :display to define expressions that
  are printed whenever interactive mode is entered.  :display and :print
  take same format and width modifiers.  :expris [expr] to determine the
  width and type of an expression.  Use :varis [var.] to determine type,
  width and declaration keywords of a variable.  Use :whatis [name] to
  determine all uses of an identifier name.  Entire qualified path from
  function scope required for accessing variables in named blocks in
  functions.

Listing source statements:
  The normal $list([scope]) system task can list all of any task or module.
  The :list command lists 10 lines from a selected location that can be
  a scope or a [file:][line] reference or argument relative to last listed
  line.  Type ':set listsize [number]' to change the number of lines listed.
  The current listing location is independent of current scope except when
  :scope or $scope is executed, the current list line is set to the first
  line of the scope.  Also since ',' and :[i]step and hitting a breakpoint
  print a source line, those commands change the current list line.
  The explicit [file:][line] list command lists in a new file and :list ++
  lists the beginning of the next source file (:list -- the previous end).
  Only these three commands can change listing file.  Type ':help :list'
  for the format of the various :list command options.

Setting interactive scope:
  The $scope([scope xmr]) system task changes interactive scope.  The :scope
  command also changes scope but allows a more general reference.  The
  :breakpoint command takes a scope reference argument.  Format is:
 
  [file:][line] - first instance of scope determined by [file:][line].
       [file] can be source file, -y or -v path or any path tail if it is
       unique.  [line] must be between module - endmodule.  Any ':' in
       [file] name must be escaped with a back slash.  Scope set to type or
       first instance but other command argument may select instance for
       :breakpoint.  Scope list line set to first line of scope not [line].
       [line] is same as [file:][line] where [file] is current file.
 .. or .u - upward scope first line - if scope in task - one up task or
       instance containing task (not up instance).
 .d - first line of scope of first contained instance (not contained task).
 [module name]  - first instance of module unless name declared as instance
       in current scope, then normal downward hierarchical reference.
 [hierarchical ref.] - first line of instance - same as $scope argument.

Behavioral statement breakpoints:
  Use the :breakpoint or :ibreakpoint commands to set a breakpoint at a
  specific source statement.  The break occurs before statement execution.
  :breakpoint breaks in all instances and :ibreakpoint breaks only in the
  specified instance.  The :breakpoint argument can be any scope or line
  reference.  If no line reference is given the break is at the first
  initial, always or task statement of the scope.  For :ibreakpoint the
  argument must be an instance reference that may optionally be followed by
  a ',' and a line reference.  For a line reference, the breakpoint is set
  at the first procedural statement at or following the line in the scope.
 
  Type ':help :breakpoint' or ':help :ibreakpoint' for other options and
  argument format.  Use ':info breakpoints' to print a list of breakpoints
  ':delete [number]' to delete breakpoint [number] (no argument deletes all),
  ':disabl [number]' to temporarily disable breakpoint and ':enable [number]'
  to re-enable.  :tbreakpoint and :tibreakpoint are identical to :ibreak
  and :break except breakpoint removed when hit.  :cond adds expression to
  breakpoint that must be true to cause stop. :ignore adds count of how many
  hits to ignore before halting.

Breaking on net changes:
  Enter a delay or event control followed by the $stop system task to
  enter interactive mode on value change.  Normally the event control
  statement will be in a loop (probably a forever) because otherwise the
  break is disabled after each trigger.  Also when interactive mode is
  entered from an interactive $stop, a step (',', ':', :step, or :istep)
  command must be entered before using [number] to re-enable a history
  statement.  For example: 'forever @(posedge clock) $stop;' is usually
  better than '@(posedge clock) $stop;'

History mechanism:
  A command is re-executed by entering its history number.  A uncompleted
  command (such as a Verilog wait or delay control) is disabled by entering
  -[number] where [number] is command's assigned number in history list.
 
  The $history system task prints the most recent 20 (or histlistsize if
  different) history entries.  The debugger :history [optional number]
  command is more flexible because if an optional number argument appears,
  that many elements are printed (0 for all).  The interactive command
  prompt is 'C[number] >' where [number] is a command's history number.
  The one character, [number] to execute, [-][number] to disable and
  incorrect (such as mistyped Verilog statement entered interactively)
  commands are not added to the history list.
 
  All commands input during a run are retained.  Use $nokeepcommands to
  suppress history accumulation and $keepcommands to re-enable in $input
  scripts.  +nokeepcomands command line option disables history saving for
  programs that run a simulation by supplying command input through a pipe.
  :emptyhistory command discards all retained history commands and resets
  command number to one.  If any history commands are enabled (have not yet
  completed or been disabled), :emptyhistory will fail.  When an interactive
  Verilog statement is executed, if it can be executed immediately (no
  delays, events or tasks enables), it is executed from inside debugger and
  control remains in interactive mode.  Non immediate statements are
  scheduled after already scheduled events and resumes.  $stop or the
  interrupt signal (^c) must then be used to reenter interactive mode.  Use
  ':set histlistsize' to set default number of history commands to list and
 ':info histlistsize' to see current number.

Determining and setting internal debugger state values:
  The ':info [debugger value name]' command prints the current value of
  a debugger value.  The ':set [debugger value name] [value]' command
  changes a debugger value.  Type ':help :info' or ':help :set' for the list
  of debugger info value names.

The following system tasks may be useful during interactive debugging:
   $finish;  Terminate simulation.
   $list([scope reference]);  list source lines of scope (:list is
      alternative).  $list does not print variables values, use $showvars
      or :print <expr> for that.  Also $list does not mark source lines
      with pending events.
   $system("[OS command string]");  Escape to a sub shell and execute the
      command string (alternative is :shell [command string]).  Use empty
      string ("") to invoke an interactive sub-shell.
   $flushlog;  Call OS flush of buffers for log file and trace file.  Can
      then use :shell to invoke your editor to inspect output.
   $history;  Print history list to stdout and log file.  Contrary to XL,
      '$history;' prints last 20 (or histlistsize) commands.  Use
      ':history <num>' to print <num> commands.  <num> 0 prints all. :set
      sets and :info prints debugger histlistsize parameter that determines
      number of commands to list.
 $keepcommands;, $nokeepcommands;  Enable (or disable) saving of commands
      entered interactively to history list.  Default is $keepcommands.
      Use the +nokeepcommands command line option to disable saving of
      commands to the history list unless '$keepcommands;' is executed.
   $input([string]);  Process interactive commands from [string] file.
   $nolog;, $log;  All commands in $input scripts will be copied to the
      log file unless $nolog is used.  To re-enable log file output, use
      $log; with no argument.  To change log file use $log([string]).
   $reset;, $reset_count;, $reset_value;  During debugging reset to start
      of simulation.  :reset command is better during debugging since it
      returns to time 0 leaving the reset count unaffected and allows stop.
   $scope;  Change interactive environment scope to avoid a need to type
      full paths for variable names.  :scope and automatic scope tracking
      are intended to lessen need to set explicit interactive scopes.
      $scope can set scope to function named block but next ineractive entry
      (from step?) will change scope to function body scope.
   $showallinstances;  Print all instances in design with source file and
      line location.  Useful to find module whose name is forgotten.
      +printstats and +printallstats give more detailed information.
      If no other window is available, use $flushlog; and :shell to view.
   $showscopes;  Used to show scopes in current interactive scope.  Can be
      called with non zero argument to list entire design scope map.
   $showvariables;, $showvars  Print all variables in current scope. :print
      is more terse but $showvars prints more for multiple fan-in wires.
   $shapshot; print up to 5 pending procedural and 5 pending declarative
      events and status of every interactive thread.  Same as :snapshot.
   $display, $write  Write values.  Alternative :print is more flexible but
      these tasks allow formatted output.

... printing : debugger help command messages
:help [optional topic or :[command] name prefix]
   Print help message.

:shell [rest of line is OS command]
   Execute rest of line as OS command in sub-shell.  Notice no quotes needed.
   Empty rest of line to spawn interactive shell.  Equivalent to
   '$system([quotes OS command string]);' system task.

:where
   Print back trace of most recently suspended control thread including all
   upward thread enables with source and scope locations.  To see a listing
   of all pending scheduled event activity and thread states use $snapshot;
   or :snapshot.  :where corresponds as closely as possible to normal
   call stack trace back.  ':' prints instance scope and last source
   listing location.  If :where fails, suspension was from declarative code.
   Try single step and entering :where again.

:quit
   Exit.  Equivalent to $finish;

:print [/format][#width] [expression]
   Evaluate and print expression.  If [/format] is present, interpret the
   value according to format.  Formats are:  'd' (decimal), 'u' (unsigned),
   'b' (binary), 'h' or 'x' (hex), 's' (string), or 'c' (1 character).  If
   the [/format] is omitted, use current default unless the expression is a
   string or real.  Starting default base is hex, but use ':set printbase'
   to set different default base.  /u format prints bit pattern as unsigned.
   If [#width] value is present, interpret as [width] wide, instead of width
   computed from operator width rules.  Any format or width are ignored for
   reals, use $realtobits to view bit pattern.

:reset [stop]
   Reset simulation back to time 0 and restart simulation.  Interactive mode
   must be explicitly entered by interrupt (^c), calling $stop or [stop]
   option.  If a -i startup file was given it is executed on interactive
   entry.  $reset_count and $reset_value are not changed.  If optional
   :reset stop argument is present, stop just before simulation, else rerun
   without stopping even if -s option was given on command line.  Equivalent
   to $reset system task but can be used to restart for debugging models
   that use the $reset system task.  The $reset system task uses the -s
   option unless the first argument is non zero and stops before simulation.
   All uncompleted interactive statements are disabled by either :reset
   or $reset.  They are re-enabled by typing history command number or
   running -i start up interactive file.  Debugger state : breakpoints
   (left enabled) and history are preserved.

:expris [expression]
   Print type and width of expression.  Use to determine Verilog width and
   property rules for complex expressions.

:varis [variable]
   Print type and width and declaration keywords of variable.

:whatis [identifier]
   Print symbol information for every use of identifier.  Also, emits one
   instance reference for each use, so a breakpoint can be set.

:list [range]
   List source within [range] lines.  Some [range]s are relative to last
   printed line.  Any scope change or $list or previous :list command
   changes the last printed line.  Legal [range]s are:
 
     + or [empty]             10 lines starting with last printed.
     +0                       10 lines around current line.
     -                        10 lines ending 1 before previous first line.
     ++                       First 10 lines of next file.
     --                       Last 10 lines of previous file.
     [file]:[number]          10 lines around [number] in file [file].
     [number]                 10 lines around [number] in current file.
     [+/-][offset]            10 lines starting [offset] from current.
     [+/-][num1],[+/-][num2]  Range, if [+/-] offset from current line.
     [scope reference]        First 10 lines starting at [scope].
 
   By default 10 lines are list, use ':set listsize [number]' to change
   number of printed lines to [number].  Notice stepping with ';' does not
   change last printed line.  Use [file]:[number] to list inside `include
   files.  ++ and -- exit to file and line of first inclusion of file.
   Read library files are same as source files.

:set [debugger parameter] [value]
   Set debugger internal parameter to [value].  Legal set parameters are:
 
   :set listsize [number]     Default is 10 lines to list.
   :set histlistsize [number] Default is 20 history commands to list.
   :set noscopechange         Disable automatic scope setting on entry to
                              interactive mode.
   :set scopechange           Re-enable automatic scope setting on.  Scope
                              not set to named blocks in functions.
   :set printbase [base]      Set default :print command base, values: hex
                              (default), decimal, octal binary.
   :set nologecho             Turn off writing of input interactive commands
                              the log file (default).
   :set logecho               Turn on writing of input commands.

:info [debugger parameter]
   Show value of debugger state or parameter setting.  Legal info parameters
   are: listsize, histlistsize, scopechange, breakpoints, displays,
   printbase and logecho.  For breakpoints and auto-display expressions
   prints status information for each.

:scope [scope reference]
   Change interactive scope to [scope reference] location.  Type
   ':help scope' for list of legal scope selection forms.  Any [line] is
   used only to determine surrounding scope.  Scope only applies to
   interactive mode and system tasks that explicitly are defined to use the
   interactive scope.   Extended version of $scope system task.  If scope
   set to function named block scope, next interactive entry will change
   scope to function body scope (assuming scopechange mode active).

:breakpoint [scope reference] or none
   Set statement breakpoint at all instances of [scope reference].  Type
   ':help scope' for a list of legal [scope reference] forms.  If the
   reference selects an instance, only the type of the instance is used.
   If the [scope reference] is not a [file:][line] reference, use first
   initial, always or task statement of scope.  If no argument, set at
   last :list argument (first if range, closest if backward) that must be
   within task, function or initial or always block.  Setting a breakpoint
   at a line means the first procedural statement at or after the line (but
   must be within scope).  Type ':help breakpoints' for discussion of other
   breakpoint commands.

:ibreakpoint [scope reference][,[file:][line]] or none
   Set statement breakpoint at instances of [scope reference] file [file]
   and [line] line.  Type ':help scope' for a list of legal [scope ref.]s,
   but here only explicit instance scope references are legal.  If the
   ',[file:][line]' argument is omitted, use first statement of first
   initial, always, or task (for task scope).  If ',[line]' but no [file]
   is given, use first or only file of scope.  If no scope reference and
   only ',[file:][line]' is given, use current scope.  No argument means
   set at last :list argument (first if range, closest if backward)
   that must be within task, function, or initial or always block.
   Type ':help breakpoints' for discussion of other breakpoint commands.

:delete [optional type] [number]
   Delete breakpoint or display expression with number [number] or all if
   number is omitted.  [optional type] is breakpoints or displays (default
   if omitted is breakpoints).  Type 'info breakpoints' or 'info displays'
   to determine breakpoint or auto-display number.  If [number] is omitted,
   delete all breakpoints or auto-display expressions.

:enable [optional type] [number]
   Enable breakpoint or display with number [number].  [optional type]
   is either breakpoints or displays (breakpoints is default if omitted) and
   can be abbreviated to first letter.  Type 'info breakpoints' or
   'info displays' to determine breakpoint or auto-display expression
   number and enable state.

:disabl [optional type] [number]
   Temporarily disable breakpoint or display with number [number].
   [optional type] is breakpoints or displays (breakpoints is default if
   omitted) and can be abbreviated to first letter. Type 'info breakpoints'
   or 'info displays' to determine breakpoint or auto-display number and
   enable state.  Notice final e must not appear to avoid conflict with
   Verilog disable keyword (any unique prefix such as 'disa' works).  Also
   notice that :disabl disables an added : debugger breakpoint, but disable
   statement or -[number] disables simulation of a Verilog statement.

:step [optional repeat count]
   Step to next procedural line.  Execute one statement or statements on
   current line, stop before first statement of next line.  May process
   pending declarative events before stepping.  Execution steps into any
   task or function.  Equivalent to ',' interactive Verilog command.
   Always prints location after stopping.  if optional repeat count, step
   that many times before stopping and printing message.  If interrupt (^c)
   or breakpoint hit during stepping, stop stepping and enter interactive
   mode.

:istep [optional repeat count]
   Step to next procedural statement that is in same instance tree location.
   Otherwise identical to :step.  If debugger entered by interrupt, use one
   :step before :istep since scope may have been in module without any
   procedural statements.  :istep uses currently executing instance not
   interactive scope set by $scope.

:history [optional number]
   Print 20 (or value of histlistsize info debugger parameter) commands.
   If [number] appears, print [number] (0 means all) history commands.
   Pauses and prompts for CR every histlistsize lines.

:emptyhistory
   If all history commands have completed or are disabled with (-[number]
   command), discard retained history and set next history command to 1.

:display [/format][#width] [expression]
   Set up [expression] in display table so that it is displayed on every
   entry to interactive mode.  Arguments are identical to :print command.
   Use ':delete display' or ':undisplay' to delete all auto-display
   expressions.  If either is followed by a number, delete that numbered
   display only.  Use ':info display' to list current displays.  ':display'
   with no arguments displays all current auto-display expressions.
   Use 'enable display' and 'disabl display' to temporarily turn off or on
   an auto-display expression.

:undisplay [optional number]
   Delete [number] auto-display expression or all current if [number] is
   not present.  Same as ':delete display' command.

:tbreakpoint [scope reference] or none
   Command identical to :breakpoint except breakpoint is temporary and
   removed after it is hit the first time.  To avoid tracing in task or
   function (approximate DBX/GDB next command), use the :nextb command.
   It sets a :tibreak at the next line and executes a '.' command.  Because
   of delay and event controls, other threads may be executed before break
   is hit.  The :ignore command can be used with :tbreakpoint.  After
   ignore count hits, the break point is taken and then removed.

:tibreakpoint [scope reference][,[file:][line]] or none
   Command identical to :ibreakpoint except breakpoint is temporary and
   removed after it his the first time (see :tbreakpoint help).  Only
   stops in instance that is same as scope reference instance.

:ignore [breakpoint number] [ignore count]
   Do not stop at break point [number] until [ignore count] hits of the
   break point have occurred.  Ignore count assumes last hit was 0th.
   To remove an :ignore count, use 'ignore [break number] 0'.  Use
   ':info breakpoints' to determine number of hits and any pending ignore
   count.

:cond [breakpoint number] [optional condition expression]
   Do not stop at break point [number] unless [expression] evaluates to
   a positive non x/z value (i.e. true).  Expression will be checked and
   evaluated in instance and task/function or named block scope of break
   point.  Since Verilog variables persist, :cond expression variable always
   have values.  Conditions are evaluated before ignore counts so if
   condition is false hit count does not rise.  Use ':cond [break number]'
   to remove condition.

:snapshot
   Print snapshot of current procedural location and list of statement at
   which each procedural (per instance) thread suspended at.  Also lists
   pending events on head of event list.  May be long so one way to view it
   is to type: $flushlog; then ':sh [evoke editor on verilog.log file]'.

:nextb
   Abbreviation for :tibreak [line number of next thread statement]
   followed by '.'.  Analog of DBX/GDB next command steps over current
   statement.  Break point is visible and can be removed before it is hit.
   If no next statement in thread, temporary break point not set and error
   message emitted.  :nextb over task enable may execute other threads
   before stopping if the task contains event or delay controls.  :nextb
   and for that matter any temporary break point do not use up a break
   point number unless a new break point is set before temporary break
   point is hit.  See ':help :tbreakpoint' and ':help statements' for
   more information.
